Mindset & Mood
Today felt like one of those self-aware, reflective, and productive days — a mix of deep thoughts, project progress, and emotional clarity. I felt more in control of myself, with a strange blend of motivation, curiosity, and inner maturity. Somewhere between feeling like a 16-year-old and questioning if I’m even that young — maybe I’m something else altogether.

Projects & Progress
Hackathon Project Update:
Completed major parts like the Home Page and Timeline — clean, engaging, and even added audio narration which gave it a richer, interactive vibe. Planning to build the Culture Page, Credits, and a Gallery with Maps next, but decided to take a well-earned break.

Also planned for easy progress ahead — those remaining sections will be straightforward. Timeline is on track.

Content Creation
Recorded the second video showing off 2 projects and how I’m working on them.
Will post it in 2–3 days to keep the flow spaced out.
Started to think deeper about YouTube growth and how others my age — even people I met in games like Minecraft — are hitting 1M+ subs. Felt a bit jealous, but it’s turning into fuel.

Real Talk (Emotions + People)
Noticed by Girls:
There’s a girl at school who occasionally looks at me — I don’t know why, but it feels... good. In coaching too, I noticed a girl from the building opposite the classroom. Didn’t exchange any words, just saw her from a distance. No interest in chaos or drama, just this quiet feeling of being noticed.

I’m not looking to start anything — I know I’ll move out for undergrad and M.Tech later. These people might not stay in my life, so I’m focusing on self-growth and discipline.

Spiritual Vibes:
Talked about how I sound like a spiritual baba sometimes. I don’t like giving advice unless someone asks for it. It’s better to stay quiet until my words are needed.

Hobby Insight: FPV Drones
Talked about my interest in building FPV racing drones.
Want to start with a tiny drone that still gives a long flight time.
Budget estimate:
₹8,000–₹20,000 for full setup (drone, controller, FPV goggles, batteries).
Thinking of building my first one soon. Definitely a side project to look forward to!

Reflections
Sometimes I feel like I’m more emotionally and mentally mature than people my age.
I crave deep conversations, real projects, meaningful work — not attention, not drama.
The world might move fast, but I want to move with purpose.
As for now, I’m building — one block, one project, one thought at a time.
