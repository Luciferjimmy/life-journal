Ethical Hacking Practice & Recon on inDrive Cargo
Todayâ€™s Target:
Domain: cargo.indrive.com

Program: inDrive (Bug Bounty scope confirmed on HackerOne)

Recon & Observations:
Discovered login flow on cargo.indrive.com using OTP-based authentication.

Found initial request to GET /proxy/cargo/v2/client/config which loads before OTP â€” indicates client-side logic bootstrapping.

Noted that the web app uses API endpoints directly on the browser, opening up room for:

OTP endpoint fuzzing

CAPTCHA bypass attempts

OTP logic flaws

Next Steps & Attack Plan:
Capture OTP Request

Check if OTP can be spammed (rate limiting).

Test for number enumeration.

Capture OTP Verification Request

Replay OTPs.

Try malformed payloads, blank OTPs.

Attempt weak OTPs (123456, 000000).

Check for OTP reuse and session binding flaws.

Headers Tampering

Test removing or altering Origin, Referer.

Bypass CAPTCHA (if present)

Modify/omit captcha token and analyze behavior.

Tools Used:
Burp Suite (Intercept & Repeater)

HackerOne for Scope Confirmation

Chrome Dev Tools for Request Monitoring

Reflections:
This was my first real recon on a live bounty target. The OTP login flow seems like a great place to test logic flaws and weak auth. Learned how to break down an authentication flow, map API calls, and prepare a bug bounty testing plan.

ðŸ§ª Next Goal:
Finish testing the OTP flow. If any valid bug is found, prepare a clean and professional HackerOne disclosure report with PoC and video demo.
