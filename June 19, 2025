Journal Entry – 19 June 2025

Today felt powerful — not because I achieved something huge, but because I took a step. I launched my very first fundraiser. I remember just staring at the "submit" button on Milaap and wondering — “Will anyone even donate?” But I still went for it. That’s growth. That’s action.

Before this, I tried on Ketto, but it got rejected within seconds. And yeah, it stung. But I didn’t let it stop me. Maybe that’s what makes today special. I didn’t let a "no" kill the bigger "why." I want to help kids in rural areas — not in theory, not just in my head — but in real, visible ways. Whether it’s giving them notebooks, organizing a quiz, or just helping them feel seen.

I shared the campaign on LinkedIn too. That was a big step for me. I kept thinking, “What if no one cares?” But even if they don’t, I care. That’s enough to keep going.

And honestly, I didn’t tell my parents everything yet. They wouldn’t understand right now. They’d say “focus on your boards” — and they’re not wrong. But they don’t get this feeling I have inside me. This drive to build, to do something meaningful, to not just exist but impact. I hope one day they’ll see why this matters to me.
