Journal Entry – 20 June 2025

Something real happened today.

My aunt helped run a small awareness event in her school — and I got to see the kids. The energy in that room, the innocent smiles, the claps, the way they interacted… it made everything worth it. I wasn’t there physically, but in a way, my work reached them. I contributed. And it felt... real. Not a simulation, not a plan — reality.

And here's the thing: I’m not doing this for claps. I’m not doing this to look good on an application. I’m doing this because I want to. Because when I see a kid smiling while holding a notebook, knowing that it might just be their first new one this year — that matters. Even if I help just 10 kids. Even if I light the spark in just one of them — that’s everything.

Part of me still wonders — am I wasting time? Should I just be studying instead? But no. This is study. This is life study. This is value creation. This is the kind of education they don’t teach — the education of empathy.

MIT or not, I want to be someone who helps. Someone who builds. Someone who leads not with titles, but with actions. I don’t know what tomorrow will bring. But today? Today I feel proud.
