12 July 2025 â€” Persistence and Polish

"Errors donâ€™t break me â€” they train me."



Fought through platform bugs, custom config errors, and NDK mismatches.

Successfully made the app relaunch cleanly from the login state without default splash artifacts.

Finalized the initial visual stack: Transition â†’ Login Screen, using only Flutter-managed UI.

Cleaned up the styles.xml and launch_background.xml to eliminate unwanted app logo flashes.

ðŸ’¡ Lesson: Real polish lies beyond "it works." Itâ€™s about how it works, and what doesnâ€™t get in the way.
