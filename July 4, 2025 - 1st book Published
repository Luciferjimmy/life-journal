July 4, 2025 – The Day I Became a Published Author
“I didn’t write for readers. I wrote to survive myself.”

After barely sleeping, I woke up to finish the final formatting of the book. Kindle Direct Publishing was open in one tab. My manuscript in another. I worked through page numbers, white pages, acknowledgments, spine width, bleed, margins — things I never thought I’d care about.

Every technical struggle felt like a test of will.

I uploaded the final cover — black and minimal, because sometimes, fire hides in the dark.

Then I hit PUBLISH.

A pause.

Silence.

Then adrenaline. Not the kind that shouts. The kind that settles. The kind that says: You did it.

But I didn’t celebrate. No music. No screaming. Just sat there in silence again. Because what I’d done wasn’t for validation. It was a ritual. I had turned my pain, struggle, hunger, and questions into something physical. A book. A mirror.

And it didn’t even feel like success.

It felt like a beginning.
