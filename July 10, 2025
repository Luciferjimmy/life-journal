10 July 2025 â€” The Transition Begins

"Built with frustration. Powered by persistence."



Switched from buggy Xcode iOS simulator to Android Studio for better stability.

Configured Flutter app to run on a real Android device (Samsung M34).

Installed Android NDK, fixed Gradle sync issues, and handled Firebase plugin compatibility warnings.

Launched the first successful build directly on my phone.

Lesson: When platforms get in the way, adapt. Shift tools, keep building.
