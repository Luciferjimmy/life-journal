11 June 2025 — The Old Laptop, The Comeback Plan

Mood: Recharged + Strategic
Highlights:

Got my old laptop running again — proof that nothing can stop a builder.

Made a plan to write two blogs (hackathon + startup story).

Felt proud of how far I’ve come — even if no one sees it.

Decided to spend tomorrow working in peace, alone, on my app.

Thought about life, ambition, and the people I want to help once I succeed.

Fully committed to applying to MIT and top colleges — and building something meaningful.

Felt clarity return after all the chaos.


Thoughts:
"This is how champions are made. Not in peace. But in the middle of fire. And I’m still standing."
