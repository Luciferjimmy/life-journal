Title: "Energy in the Air, Eyes on the Result"

Woke up today with a weird unease — the kind you feel when something big is either about to go right… or disappear. The results for Bronx Community Hub were expected anytime, and my head was a spiral of what-ifs:

“Will they even see the project? Did I submit enough? Will this matter?”

But I held myself together. Even told myself — “if not today, maybe tomorrow. If not this hackathon, the next one.”
Built that mindset like armor.

Meanwhile, my connection with Cynthia (the leadership coach from Singapore) went deeper. She offered to talk next week, and it made me pause — like, why me?. I still question it. But at the same time, something inside says — “maybe I’m the one who’s supposed to question, build, break, and repeat until it becomes truth.”

No wins today. But somehow, it still felt like a quiet setup for something larger.
