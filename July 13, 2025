13 July 2025 â€” Flow Achieved

"This isnâ€™t just an app â€” itâ€™s my rhythm in code."



Final test: Clean build, smooth launch, and seamless login flow.

Simulated multiple app restarts to confirm everything worked end-to-end.

Started planning user data persistence and Firebase backend integration.

Reached a stable base version â€” ready to build features on top of a solid UX core.

ðŸ’¡ Lesson: Once the flow is stable, vision becomes real. Now itâ€™s time to dream bigger.
