June 26, 2025 - Three Hackathons, One Flame

I submitted to three hackathons today.
Not because I’m trying to chase clout.
Because I can’t sit still when I know I can do more.

It almost felt divine — like something was guiding my fingers, helping me click through forms, compress images, write descriptions.
The kind of flow where your brain goes silent and your soul takes over.

I realized today:
I’m not building projects. I’m building proof.
Proof that I can create under pressure.
Proof that I don’t need a team to move.
Proof that my vision isn’t just a vibe — it’s real.
