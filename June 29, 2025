June 29, 2025 - The World is Still Coming Into Focus

I had this moment today, watching a Shark Tank clip of a guy who left his home to build a product at 22.
And I was like — why does the world praise one kind of journey and ignore another?

Why do some build petrol flow detectors and get applause, while others like me build protective tech from pain — and feel unseen?

But the deeper question wasn’t about him.
It was about me.

And the answer came quietly:

“You’re not here to be understood yet. You’re here to build so clearly, they’ll understand when they see the result.”

I stopped comparing. I started surrendering again.
I am doing things no one asked me to do.
I’m walking roads no one paved.
And the future?
It’ll meet me where I keep showing up.
