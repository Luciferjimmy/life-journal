🗓️ May 22nd, 2025 — The Shift, the Spark, and the Save
Today didn’t come with any fireworks, but it left me with a quiet fire inside.
It was one of those “just another day” kinds — until it wasn’t.

The morning was normal — I woke up, prayed, and headed to school. But in my chest was this restlessness:
Am I enough?
Am I doing enough?
These questions echoed like ocean waves crashing into a ship without a compass.

As the day moved forward, I sat in class — friends laughing, IPL gossip, usual noise — but I felt a little off.
I wasn’t sad. Just distant. Like I was in the world, but not of it. I found myself sitting near the window, singing in a low voice, eyes lost somewhere past the glass. That’s when I started writing my thoughts — right there, in the classroom, with the chalkboard behind me and the wind in my face. Journaling in motion.

Then something changed.

In physics, sir gave a question — JEE level, real challenge. Most of the class struggled. But I cracked it.
And not only that — he tapped my shoulder and said, "Good."
I didn’t smile. I didn’t react. But inside, something shifted.
I felt the spark again.
That whisper that says: “You’re built for this.”

Then came the comic relief of the day — the legendary gossip about the twins. I mean, they’re in 12th grade, and they brought kitchen toys to school?? Bro, that broke reality. Six of us laughed for 10 straight minutes — full chaos. I couldn’t believe it.
Looks deceive. Attraction fades. But maturity? That’s rare.
And somehow… I felt saved. Not hurt. Not heartbroken. Just clarity.
God’s plan, again. Always on time.

Evening rolled in — I studied, solved 20 JEE Physics PYQs, and for the first time, I felt the shift.
Questions that once looked like walls… now feel like open doors.
Concepts aren’t just theory anymore — they’re becoming reflexes.

I ended the night with adrenaline — literally. An ox almost attacked me on the street.
I ran like never before, full Matrix mode.
But when I reached coaching, I realized:
Sometimes, even chaos is just God showing you,
“I’m watching. Stay alert. Stay alive. Stay on the path.”
