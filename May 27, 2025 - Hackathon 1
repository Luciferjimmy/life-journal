Project: Hackathon Website — "From Bombay to Mumbai"
Day: 1 / 4
Theme: History | Heritage | Transformation

Progress Made Today:
✅ Finalized concept: "From Bombay to Mumbai – The City of Seven Dreams"

✅ Designed and implemented the homepage hero section with a regal artwork and cinematic typography

✅ Created a thematic navbar with sections: Home | Timeline | Heritage | Culture | Gallery

✅ Added a vertical image archive sidebar (vintage photos) for an authentic, archival look

✅ Chose fonts and styles that reflect the historical narrative and colonial-to-modern evolution

✅ Tested layout on local server, took screenshots, and visually evaluated the first impression

Reflection:
Today was powerful.
I realized how much storytelling matters — it’s not just a website, it’s an experience. Every font, image, and word must reflect Bombay’s transformation. I felt proud when I saw the first draft — not perfect yet, but it already carries soul. This project connects my coding skills with history and emotion. That’s rare.

Goals for Tomorrow (Day 2):
Build the Timeline section with key historical events (1661 → 1995)

Add scroll-based animations or transitions

Begin structuring Heritage and Culture pages

Improve mobile responsiveness

Optimize image layout and fonts

Mood: Focused, Inspired, a bit uncertain about college admissions — but this project made me feel like I’m doing something meaningful.
Time Spent Today: ~5 hours

“Cities are not just made of roads and buildings — they’re made of memory. And today, I started building a city out of memory.”
