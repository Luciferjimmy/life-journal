June 25, 2025 - From Thought to Code in 3 Hours
Today was one of those lightning-strike days. The kind where an idea doesn’t just arrive — it takes over.
In under 3 hours, I built a Chrome extension that blocks adult content before it even loads.
Not with some parental-control nonsense. But with actual logic, actual design, actual values.

It wasn't just about tech. It was about pain.
About the reality of exploitation, the way the internet preys on people, and the false freedom sold through clicks.

I made the extension not just to win a hackathon.
I made it because someone had to.
And maybe — just maybe — if enough people like me build things like this, some kid out there won’t stumble into a spiral they never asked for.
