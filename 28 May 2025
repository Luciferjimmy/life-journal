## Summary of Progress

### Firebase Auth-Based Flutter App
- Implemented Splash Screen, Login, and Signup.
- Firebase Auth integration (email/password).
- Google Sign-In functionality successfully added.
- Persistent login setup complete.
- Started working on Home Page design â€” aiming for a clean, aesthetic experience with animated drawer and stunning theme.

### Firebase Limitations
- Currently using Firebase free plan â€” **Storage not accessible**, so PDF uploads/downloads (for resumes) are being handled differently.
- Decided to store resumes locally or generate from template using HTML-to-PDF in-app (Flutter package planned).

## What I Learned Today
- Firebase Auth basics with Google sign-in in Flutter.
- Handling persistent sessions in Flutter.
- Importance of UI/UX: a good app isnâ€™t just functional â€” it should *wow* the user.
- Markdown and GitHub Journaling for dev tracking.

---

## In Progress
- Designing and coding a beautiful Home Page UI:
  - Animated slider drawer.
  - Clean theme and consistent design language.
- Resume Builder templates (basic layout ideas in mind).
- Will later integrate dynamic data entry and export to PDF within Flutter.

## Tools & Tech Stack

## Personal Reflection
Iâ€™m still at the beginning, but I can already feel the excitement of building something real. Even though Iâ€™m just starting out in Flutter, Iâ€™m confident that this project will turn into something impressive â€” both technically and visually.

Iâ€™ll be uploading every step to GitHub and journaling regularly to stay consistent and accountable.

## Next Steps
- Finalize UI/UX of home screen.
- Implement 2â€“3 resume templates (static layout first).
- Add theme toggle (dark/light).
- Explore offline saving mechanism if Firebase Storage remains inaccessible.
