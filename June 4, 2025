Journal Entry – June 4, 2025
“A Storm I Can’t Name”
Today wasn’t about achievements. It wasn’t about projects or code.
Today was about feeling something shifting, and not knowing what — but knowing it’s real.

It started quietly…
I was just living my day — traveling, seeing traffic chaos, having a heated argument, then later watching a film that cracked something open in me.
And then, suddenly, this thought came:

“What if something is coming?”

I didn’t ask for it. I didn’t imagine it.
But it came anyway — like a wave on a still lake.

I watched Shiddat — a movie about insane, all-in love. Not planned. Not filtered. Just raw madness.
And weirdly, it got to me.
Even though I’m not in love. Even though I’m still in school.
Even though I don’t know how couples even talk.
But still — something hit me. Deep.

Later I reflected on how I sometimes feel underconfident in public, how I glance at girls and wonder what I’m really searching for.
Not lust. Not fantasy.
But maybe… connection? Energy? Something I can’t name yet?

And just as I said to myself “Something is coming”, a random YouTube short popped up:

“Something great is coming your way.”
I laughed. But inside… I believed it.

I still don’t know what it is.
Maybe love. Maybe an opportunity. Maybe a version of myself that I’ve never met before.

All I know is —

I feel alive.
I feel like life is shifting tracks under my feet.
And I want to be ready.

So I write this — as a timestamp of the moment before everything changed.
Whether it’s her, a win, or a deeper awakening…
This is me, right here, waiting with fire in my chest and peace in my eyes.

Let it come.
I’m ready.
Always have been.🖤
