Morning
Woke up with a clear plan: finalize and polish the Bombay to Mumbai project for the history hackathon. Started early and went straight into UI adjustments, design corrections, and timeline formatting. Fixed responsive issues, restructured the audio narration logic, and refined the culture and gallery tabs.

Afternoon
Made heavy progress on documentation. Wrote a powerful, emotional README — not just technical, but human. Added markdown image links, connected screenshots, and included installation instructions. Felt the soul of the project growing with every commit. Added structure, depth, and creative storytelling — like cities telling their own stories.

Also finished uploading and submitting the entire Bombay to Mumbai project on GitHub. Pushed everything live. For the first time, the site, the repo, the narrative — everything was in sync.

Evening
Wrapped the day with a screen recording and video edit for the hackathon submission. Wrote the full story on Devpost — from "Inspiration" to "What we learned." Created and uploaded the final video with a voiceover and even background beats to give it that spark. Full submission done and dusted.

Accomplishments
Finished and submitted Bombay to Mumbai – The City of Seven Dreams

Created a video, a full GitHub repo, and Devpost submission

Wrote journal entries and documented the project fully

Reflection
This wasn’t just a history project — it became a way to speak about how I see the world. About how places hold emotion, and how tech can preserve memory. I poured my thoughts, design sense, and engineering into this. Not just for MIT, but because this is who I am becoming.
