June 27, 2025 - Tears and Code and What They Teach Me

Night hit different.
I started crying.
Not because anything went wrong.
But because the weight of wanting something so badly — MIT, Stanford, respect, recognition — just pressed down like gravity.

It’s weird. I haven’t failed yet. But I already feel the fear of failure.
The “what if I’m not enough”
The “what if my story doesn’t get heard”
The “what if I’m just a dreamer in a room of doers”

And I remembered…
Even that pain is part of the path.
Even that sadness has fuel in it.
So I cried. And I wrote. And I slept with swollen eyes and a silent promise:
Don’t stop. Not now.
