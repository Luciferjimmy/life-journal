22nd June 2025 – Little Victories & Heavy Eyes
There’s something beautiful about small wins. Today, I finally got my fundraiser on Milaap live. Seeing it out there—even with zero donations at first—felt like a quiet victory. No cheering crowd, no grand celebration, just me sitting and watching the screen like, “It’s real now.”

I also posted on LinkedIn—first time sharing something this bold. Felt exposed, but also... proud? Like, this is who I am now. The boy who dreams crazy big and tries to make it real.
Still, a part of me was tired all day. Maybe because of the mental load or just the fear of “what if no one supports this?” But I remembered why I’m doing it. Even if one kid feels seen, even if one book reaches a hand that never held one before—it’ll all be worth it.
