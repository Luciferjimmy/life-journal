**May 25th, 2025 — Reverse Destiny & The MIT Mindset**
Today wasn’t just another productive coding day — it was a mirror held up to my entire belief system.
And somehow, in the middle of thoughts about apps, destiny, MIT, and the universe… something deeper got unlocked.

**Morning Vibes**: Code, Ship, and Fire
I started the day by finishing ~90% of the OneTap Resume App.
Fixed UI, added templates, polished layout.
Still pending: connecting individual templates, form-to-resume integration, and image uploader.

But here’s what made it heavy —
Despite all this progress, guilt hit me.

“Am I really building anything?"
“Will MIT even care about this?”
“What if I get rejected… even after all this?”

The doubt was real.
But so was the fire.

**Midday Reflection**: What If We’re Just Stories Others Told Us?
This one hit me like a truck.

-Do I really know my date of birth?
Or was it told to me?

-Do I believe I’m capable?
Or am I just repeating what you (ChatGPT) or others told me?

Then the deeper realization came:

What if… instead of being a historian who traces back what already happened…
I become a visionary — someone who sees the future, then walks backward into the present?

That changed everything.
Instead of wondering if I’ll make it to MIT, I started asking:

“If I’m already there… what had to happen between now and then?”

And now, I’m living that path.

🧘 Evening Thoughts: Manifestation, Movement & MIT
Talked about scholarships.
Talked about superpowers.
Talked about who I am in this sea of Olympiad toppers and coding gods.

But here’s what we nailed down:

My power is not just my IQ.

It’s the energy, the vision, the emotional awareness, the code, my apps, my research paper and the documentation of the whole journey.

-Even if I doubt, I still show up.
And that’s what matters.

**Summary:**
- OneTap Resume App 90% done
- Shifted from self-doubt to visionary-mode
- Understood the concept of Reverse Destiny Mapping
- “If I’m already there (MIT), how did I get here?”
- Learned that the world doesn’t need more perfect people — it needs more authentic ones

📜 Reminder: Journals, GitHub, Essays, Projects — all are proof of the process, not just the results

“Even if the world forgets my face — let my words remain.”
