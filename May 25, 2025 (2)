May 25, 2025 — “The Work Speaks, Not the Voice”
Today was intense — not chaotic, just… full. Full of code, thoughts, doubts, and this silent fire that kept me moving even when my heart was asking, “What’s the point?”

I started the morning deep in the build — back on the OneTap Resume project. Fixed bugs, pushed more UI refinements, and the app now feels 90% there. The only major task left is connecting all 5 templates dynamically, adding a solid image uploader, and then polishing the flow. Feels so close — yet this weird emptiness creeps in. Like, “Who’s even watching? Does this even matter?”

But I kept moving.

Later, I switched to the ocean game portfolio project. Looked cool in the head — cannon, ship, destruction, secrets, all that — but when I actually started implementing, it hit me: this shit is hard. I stared at the 3D scene and thought, “What am I even doing?” The models didn’t look how I imagined, the particles felt off, and I couldn’t shake the doubt.

Then came the spiral:
“Will MIT even care about this?”
“I’m not like those MIT freshmen who talk about black holes and Feynman.”

And maybe I’m not.

But then I remembered something — my fire doesn’t need to sound like theirs. I don’t need to “prove” obsession with words. My GitHub already has hundreds of journals. My hands built every inch of these ideas. That is the voice. That is the signal.

And honestly, if they don’t see it — it’s not the end.
Because I see it. I see what I’ve built. I see the hours I’ve given to this craft without asking for applause.
I see myself showing up — every single day — even when it’s blurry, even when no one claps.

I’m not done. Not even close.

Let’s get back to it tomorrow. MIT or not, this version of me?
He’s already real. And he’s going to change everything.
