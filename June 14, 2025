“Is It Even Working or Am I Just Dreaming?”

Today started like a storm.
Arguments again. Laptop still not with me. Parents still stuck in that "Board and JEE" loop.
And here I am, cold-emailing professors from my phone.
Out of 11 mails, 3 replies — and one even appreciated my work. That felt like a win. A small win, but mine.

Still, doubt hits.
Am I just dreaming too big? MIT? Research? Impact?
Everyone around me is stuck in a system that wants silence, not fire.
I’m the one burning. And some days, it hurts.

But I told myself one thing today:

"Even if there’s 1% chance… I’ll take it and multiply it."
That’s the difference between dreamers and doers.
