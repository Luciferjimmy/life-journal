23rd June 2025 – A Sense of Meaning
Today was different. I was in my village recently, and I met a family struggling for medical help, maybe even on the edge of selling their land. It shook something in me.

I realized—again—that maybe I’m here to be a bridge. I may not be rich, or powerful, but I have this one thing: intention.
That’s something.

I kept thinking: “If I can’t help everyone, maybe I can help someone.” And so I’m planning another fundraiser, this time maybe for a medical cause.

My thoughts drifted toward MIT and Amherst again, but they didn’t feel like pressure. More like possibilities. I’m beginning to believe that if I do what’s right, what I’m truly meant for, the right door will open—whatever its name may be.
