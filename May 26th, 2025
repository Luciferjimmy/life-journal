May 26th, 2025 - The Overwhelm and the Fire

Today feels like a storm inside the chest. Not because something went wrong, but because everything feels too big all at once. MIT, the projects, the timelines, the comparison, the fear, the hope — all crashing together like ocean waves that won’t stop.

I woke up today with energy. I made progress — talked about shaders, boats, destruction physics, weather cycles. Fixed things. Created things. Built something from nothing. Again.

But somewhere between those lines of code and daydreams of cannonballs firing across islands, I hit a wall. Not outside. Inside.

That voice came back —
“Why now?”
“Why didn’t I start earlier?”
“What if MIT doesn’t understand?”
“Am I already too late?”

And it hit hard.

I thought about that kid in school. The one with the awards. The quiz trophies. The head start.
I thought about students already with research papers, Olympiads, gold medals, picture-perfect essays.

And I sat with this one truth:

“I didn’t start early.
But I started.
And now… I can’t stop.”

Even in this storm, I looked at everything again — the projects, the journals, the app, the portfolio, the fire I carry in every idea I touch. And I remembered:

MIT may never fully understand my chaos.
But they might feel the clarity behind it.

Because this isn’t just “application work” — it’s who I’m becoming. And that should matter more than the starting line.

I wanted to cry today.
Maybe I still will.
But I’ll cry while showing up again tomorrow.

Today taught me that dreams this big will always overwhelm — but maybe that’s the price of aiming higher than what you were given.

I wasn’t born into this path.
I didn’t get the early prep.
But I’m crafting it — day by day — with bloody hands and an open heart.

So here I am —
A 17-year-old kid,
With 14-hour days,
Building wild ideas and hoping one of them lights up the world.

If not for MIT,
Then for the version of me who refused to give up.

That’s today.

Tomorrow, we go again.
