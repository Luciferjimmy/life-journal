Journal Entry – 18 June 2025

Today was strange. I don’t know what happened, but it hit me hard — like really hard. I kept asking myself, “What am I even doing?” I’ve been so obsessed with MIT that I think I forgot who I really was. It’s not like I don’t want it — I do. More than anything. But somewhere along the line, I feel like I turned into someone else. I wasn’t always like this. I used to be full of curiosity, laughter, freedom. Now it’s just deadlines, applications, checklists, and pressure.

It’s like I tied my self-worth to a name — MIT. But am I doing this because I truly want to, or because it became an identity I built and now I’m scared to let it go? Maybe both. I don’t even know anymore. I sat alone for a while today, just thinking, and I realized — I’m still a kid. I want to learn, I want to create, but I also want to live. I want to talk with friends without constantly thinking of whether this activity is college-worthy. I want to enjoy moments without guilt.

I think I’ve been walking with my eyes on the summit, but I haven’t been feeling the journey under my feet. I prayed today. I said to God — “If it’s meant for me, it’ll come. If not, I trust You.” And I meant it. Maybe it’s time to stop chasing the name and start becoming the person. That’s what matters more. I’ll still do my best. But I’ll let go of the obsession. I’ll trust that I’m being guided.
