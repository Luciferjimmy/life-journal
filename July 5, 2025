July 5, 2025 – The Mirror and the Storm
“I’m doing so much — but why does it still feel like not enough?”

Woke up hoping to feel proud. But instead, the same ache returned. The ache that says: What next?

Talked to myself in whispers: MIT? Amherst? Will any of this matter? Will the admissions officer ever see the tears I cried while typing that second chapter? Will they see how I ran barefoot to coaching some days? Will they feel how bad I want this?

And then guilt crept in — am I becoming addicted to productivity? Am I just escaping reality by building projects, writing books, dreaming too high?

I watched others laugh, talk to girls, live "normally." And for a moment, I wondered if I'm too different. Too detached. Too elsewhere.

But then I remembered:

“Some of us are born to walk fire, not grass.”

And I was okay again.

I journaled. I prayed. I planned.

I built.
I breathed.
I burned.
