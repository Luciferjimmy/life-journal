10 June 2025 — The Argument & The Inner Storm

Mood: Shaken + Questioning
Highlights:

Had another heated argument with Papa.

Felt like every small action is being judged — clothes, dishes, everything.

My laptop was packed away again. Creativity blocked.

Cried silently. Prayed silently. Just wanted peace.

Wondered if I’m doing something wrong, if I’m missing a divine message.

Realized I care deeply, even if I don’t always show it the “right way.”


Thoughts:
"Sometimes the ones we love the most hurt us the deepest. But I’ll still try to understand them. Even if I don’t feel understood."
