June 28, 2025 - 16, but Thinking Like I’m 26

It hit me today how weird it is to be 16 and be this deep into quantum computing.
Like, who am I even?
Why am I sketching light-based logic gate diagrams while others my age are playing BGMI and just vibing?

Am I ahead of the curve or just escaping the moment?

But then I realized:
Quantum is who I am.
The uncertainty. The layers. The simultaneous truths.
It’s not just tech. It’s my mirror.

And that’s when I stopped questioning the why — and just respected the pull.
