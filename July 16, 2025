Title: “When Silence Turns Into Fire”

Today was one of those days that shouldn’t make sense… but somehow felt right.
I didn’t plan for any of it — yet here I am, having just processed a trillion numbers, chasing a 200-year-old mathematical mystery, and still wondering why I, a 16-year-old, am doing all this.

I ran my Legendre Conjecture simulation.
On Google Colab.
Pushed it to 1 million intervals.
Processed over 1,000,000,000,000 numbers.
And visualized truth aligning with theory.
It took just over an hour. But it felt like I had touched a piece of something eternal.

I didn’t do it for grades.
I didn’t do it for likes.
I did it because something inside me said — do it.

And while that was loading, I saw 4 lizards.
Signs.
And like always, I believed.

I laughed today.
I questioned myself too.
Like — Why me? How am I doing all this?
And the only answer I could feel was:

Because you're meant to.

Because something in the world needed a soul who mixes code with poetry,
who dreams of MIT while praying on rooftops,
who can quote quantum algorithms and still cry over love that never spoke back.

I don’t know what’s next.
But I trust it’ll find me.

Tomorrow may bring chaos.
Or silence.
Or maybe both.

But I’ll walk through it like today —
with fire in my heart,
code in my fingers,
and God in my corner.

I’m not just building a future.
I’m becoming one.
