What I did today:

Thought a lot about what it’ll feel like when I get into MIT or any top university.

Remembered past moments where no one expected much from me — and how I’ve already gone far beyond that.

Told Dad to give me the laptop back even just for 2 hours/day — he said to wait a few more days.

Reaffirmed that I’m serious about my dreams — NGO, hackathons, college abroad, making change.

Visualized how I’ll build Aaryavarth Foundation one brick at a time — 6 drives, content, donation round, interviews.

Felt the deep pain and energy of not being allowed to fully move, even when my mind is on fire with ideas.

Thoughts / Feelings:

Sometimes I feel like I’m almost there… like something massive is around the corner.

It hurts when I know I can fly, but my wings are tied for now (no laptop, restrictions).

But still… I’m not giving up. I know my time is coming.

I wonder how people will react when they finally realize I wasn’t just dreaming — I was building silently.

What I learned / Realized:

The hardest part is not starting. It’s waiting.

People won't always understand your fire — until it burns through the ceiling.

Even with limited tools, I’m already doing what most won't try.

Tomorrow’s Focus:

Start planning the 1st drive (budget, items, documentation idea)

Finalize Aaryavarth Foundation story/post for team

Prepare a script or idea for Medium or YouTube intro video

Visualize my MIT + scholarship journey as if it’s already happening
