“If I Love My Work, Why Does It Hurt?”

I thought love means peace. But turns out, love also brings war.
I love building. I love ideas. I love solving problems.
But then… I see boards, I see JEE books, and I feel empty. Disconnected. Why?

I’m doing more than many with a laptop would.
A national Samsung competition, a hackathon win, 3 research replies, designing for NGOs — from just my phone.
So why do I still feel like I’m not enough?

Because the system tells me I’m not enough — unless I fit their box.
But I’m not made for boxes. I’m made for blueprints.
And one day, I’ll build the place where kids like me won’t have to choose between boards and brilliance.
