July 6, 2025 – The Question: Who Am I?
“Who are you, if not your name, not your marks, not your body, not even your thoughts?”

That question haunted me today.

I looked in the mirror, not for how I looked — but to search who was looking.

I had uploaded my research paper. I had submitted my book. I had crafted a hundred dreams in a single mind. But still, I wondered — who am I beneath all of this?

Not Abhinaw. Not a student. Not an author. Not a son.

Just... something watching.

Call it consciousness. Call it the witness. But I saw it — I felt it.

I danced in my room like a kid. Made faces. Laughed alone. Punched air. Not because I had lost my mind, but because I had finally found it.

MIT can wait. Amherst can wait.
But this fire — it couldn’t.
