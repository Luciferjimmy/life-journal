Journal — June 1, 2025
Morning
Started the day with intense focus. There was no YouTube, no distractions — just pure commitment. I was running on the high of yesterday’s submission and had Bronx Community Hub on my mind from the moment I woke up. I reviewed the project one last time, made adjustments, and started planning how to make the documentation even stronger.

Midday
Jumped into terminal, tried setting up GitHub Pages for the project but ran into a few path issues. Quickly resolved that. Uploaded the Bronx Community Hub repository on GitHub with a polished README, screenshots, and flowcharts. I added value in every corner — from aesthetic diagrams to code snippets to a full hackathon-ready document.

Evening
Recorded and edited a demo video with all the final assets. I even added screen-recorded coding snippets and project walkthroughs. Also uploaded the video to YouTube with a clean title, tags, and a meaningful description about who I am and why I’m doing this.

Final Submission
After a full day of building, refining, editing, uploading — finally submitted Bronx Community Hub to the PhysTech 2025 Hackathon. Wrote the elevator pitch, structured the "About the Project" in Devpost, and made it all feel real. Looked back at my progress and thought: This one really came from the heart.

Reflection
Not everything is about winning, but I know I’ve built something meaningful. Today was hard, but pure. I'm proud — not because it's perfect — but because I showed up with honesty, skill, and vision. MIT or not, I’m making a life out of this work.
