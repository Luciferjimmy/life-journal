9 June 2025 — The Mindstorm + Hope

Mood: ⚠️ Exhausted + Inspired
Highlights:

Woke up with body pain from the cricket match.

Made tea, breakfast, cleaned dishes — felt independent.

Reflected deeply on how the Indian system suppresses creativity.

Felt divinely protected, noticing signs.

Journaled about karma — how the only thing truly in our hands is our effort.

Made a decision to trust the process, to keep building and studying.

Realized again that I’m not meant to fit in — I’m meant to change things.


Thoughts:
"Everything around feels alive — the Earth, the energy, the signs. Maybe I’m not broken… maybe I’m just being rebuilt."
