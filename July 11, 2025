"Code is not just logic. It’s the way it feels."



Implemented a custom transition screen for a smooth app launch.

Added a login screen with a username input system (user-generated or randomly assigned).

Refined Flutter navigation logic using Future.delayed for controlled screen switching.

Debugged splash screen issues; began removing the native Android launch logo to make Flutter handle all UI from the start.

💡 Lesson: Polish matters. Transitions, delays, and UI flow define the user experience.
