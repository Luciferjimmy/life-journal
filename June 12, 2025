Journal Entry — 12 June 2025

Today was strange, powerful, and quiet all at once.

It started with something I can’t fully explain — a dream or signal that woke me in the early hours, somewhere between 3 and 4 AM. Not a nightmare. Not even a regular dream. Just this massive, almost divine pull toward MIT, Harvard, purpose — the kind of future I always daydream about, but this time it didn’t feel like daydreaming. It felt real. Like something from beyond my mind said, “Get ready.”

The rest of the day was calmer on the surface, but my brain kept spinning underneath. I was thinking — why did that happen? Is it a sign? A call? A test? It felt like something inside me cracked open and said, “Now or never.”

I realized that maybe this isn’t just about going to a foreign university. Maybe it’s about becoming the person who deserves to be there. Not just smart — but wise. Not just skilled — but grounded.

I also realized: if I get that far, it won’t be because I forced it — but because I aligned with it.

So I’m choosing faith over fear. I’m choosing work over worry. And if I stumble tomorrow, I’ll stand the day after that.

Let’s see where this goes — but tonight, I sleep with belief in my chest and purpose in my pulse.
