# My life journal (aka me being way too deep at 3am)

yo what's good!! welcome to my messy brain dump where i basically document my entire existence lmao 

## what even is this??

so like... i started writing down my thoughts every day or two because honestly? life hits DIFFERENT when you're 16 and trying to figure out literally everything at once. this isn't some aesthetic journal for the gram - it's real, unfiltered, probably cringe sometimes, but it's ME.

think of it as my digital diary except i'm brave enough (or dumb enough??) to put it on github for some reason

## what you'll find in this chaos:

- **daily brain dumps** - sometimes i'm on top of the world, sometimes i'm crying over math homework. it's a vibe
- **coding adventures** - when i actually understand what i'm doing vs when i'm just copying stack overflow (we've all been there)
- **school drama** - because high school is literally a soap opera and someone needs to document it
- **existential crisis moments** - usually happen around 2am when i should be sleeping
- **random wins** - like when my code actually works on the first try (rare but magical)
- **JEE prep suffering** - because indian parents and engineering dreams, you know how it is
- **crush updates** - yeah i'm that person, fight me
- **spiritual/philosophical stuff** - sometimes i get deep okay don't judge

## why am i doing this to myself?

honestly? good question. but like:
- future me will probably thank present me for keeping track of all this
- it's kinda therapeutic ngl
- maybe someone else will read this and be like "oh thank god i'm not the only one who's a mess"
- if i ever get into MIT or something crazy, i wanna remember what it felt like BEFORE everything changed
- also my therapist says journaling is good or whatever

## the format (because i pretend to be organized):

entries go up every 1-2 days depending on:
- how much drama happened
- if i remembered to write stuff down
- whether my mental health is cooperating
- if i have wifi lol

each entry has:
- **date** (when i remembered what day it was)
- **mood/vibe** (like "dead inside but make it aesthetic")
- **the actual tea** ‚òï

sometimes there's screenshots of my original notes because my handwriting is terrible and typing is easier

## future plans (if i don't abandon this like my other 47 projects):

- maybe turn this into a blog?? 
- add some art or doodles when i'm feeling fancy
- sync with notion because i'm basic like that
- who knows, maybe write a book called "how to survive being 16 and dramatic"

## real talk though...

some days are absolute FIRE and i feel like i can conquer the world. other days i can barely get out of bed and everything feels impossible. most days are somewhere in between - just me trying my best and figuring it out as i go.

if you're reading this and you're also a mess, just know you're not alone. we're all just winging it and hoping for the best üí´

> *"idk what i'm doing but at least i'm documenting it"* - me, probably

**find me being chaotic elsewhere:**
- github: [@Luciferjimmy](https://github.com/Luciferjimmy) 
- probably overthinking everything as usual

peace out ‚úåÔ∏è

*ps: if my parents find this... hi mom and dad, i'm fine, this is just how i processes emotions*
