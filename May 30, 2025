May 30, 2025- Today was a huge milestone.

I wrapped up the Bombay to Mumbai hackathon project — the site is officially complete. Everything from the timeline to culture tab to sources page feels polished and complete. It’s not just a history website — it’s a visual storytelling experience.

I focused on making the content feel like it was coming to life:

The dark theme sets the tone for the historical journey.

I added the narration toggle for an immersive experience — like a museum guide.

Each tab is clean and engaging. The Koli Heritage section, the Portuguese rule, and the British East India Company timeline — they all pop.

I went through the code multiple times, refining details and making sure everything was aligned. My research sources were documented carefully, and the project narrative ties the whole site together.

I also wrote the README — a real deep dive into the process, challenges, and story behind it. It felt emotional to write because this project isn't just a submission — it’s a personal reflection of my growth in this journey.

After some back-and-forth, I also felt a bit of imposter syndrome, like “Is this good enough? Will I win?” But then I reminded myself that I made this. Every part of this project comes from me, my efforts, and my love for creating something meaningful.

**Next steps:**
I’m submitting this to the hackathon today. I’ll upload it to GitHub, and then I’ll start working on the blog post to tie everything together.
I’m also thinking of making a demo video and uploading it to YouTube for even more exposure.

**Today was a win.**
Not just because the site is ready — but because I’ve created something I’m proud of.
I’ve learned a lot, and the journey’s just beginning.
