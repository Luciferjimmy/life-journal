Today was even heavier, not because anything huge happened — but because the weight stayed.
Same thoughts. Same guilt. Same questions.

Why do I care so much about people who don’t care back?

My grandfather thinks I’m rude. My parents think I’m distracted.
Maybe I am. But I’m also trying. More than they’ll ever know.

Not for her.
Not for them.
But for me.
