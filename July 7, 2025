July 7, 2025, The Storm and the Stillness

Today was not just a day — it felt like a marathon through emotions, thoughts, decisions, and hidden fears.

I woke up at 5:00 AM, blurry-eyed but driven. It wasn’t just school calling, it was life pushing me to keep showing up, to not quit, even when I don’t feel enough. I wore my uniform like armor, stepped into the world, and braced for another round.

School was strange today.
Few students showed up, but I noticed things more deeply than usual. The noise of laughter echoed like a world I haven’t fully entered yet. I watched a boy — extroverted, confident, walking up to girls like it was nothing. And there I was — silent, breath stuck in my throat, wondering why it’s so hard for me. Why my voice seems to tremble when it’s needed most. That gap — between who I am and who I want to be — it stung. But I also smiled. Because I know I’m not faking anything. I’m just raw. Real. Still becoming.

On the way back, life reminded me again that nothing ever goes linear.
The van driver changed, the route got confused, and I forgot small details. Simple things — like handing over the coaching fees — slipped my mind. It scared me a little. Am I too scattered? Too distracted?

Then came the friction at home.
An argument with my father, out of nowhere. Words like arrows, saying things like "you think you’ll go to America? Can’t even get into AIT?"
I didn’t yell back. I just felt. Quietly. The kind of quiet that doesn’t mean peace — it means pressure.
But I didn’t cry this time.
And maybe that scared me more.

Because I realized: I’m getting used to it. The ache, the disbelief, the loneliness. I’m becoming immune. Not strong. Just... trained.

Then came the work.

Submission after submission.
Three to four international competitions done.
Book published. Kindle version live. Research uploaded.
What started as a spark has now become a movement inside me — and yet, I feel like I’m chasing something I can't name.

Why?
Because I still don’t feel like I’ve achieved anything.

And yet, deep down, something inside me knows:
- This is what becoming feels like.
- This confusion is the cost of growth.
- This storm is the soil where my roots are digging deep.

Evening passed. Coaching again.
Exhaustion tried to take over, but there’s too much in me that won’t let me sleep empty. I asked questions. I imagined drones flying with awareness. I thought of soil and sensors and seeds. I dreamed again — not of fame — but of meaning.

I’m not running for applause. I’m searching for a moment.
That moment when something I built changes even one person’s life.
That moment when my silence becomes someone else’s strength.
That moment when I can say — I did it my way. Fully. Fiercely.

And maybe MIT or Amherst or Stanford will never see these pages of my life. But I will.
And that’s enough to keep going.

Today, I felt tired.
Today, I felt not enough.
But today, I still showed up.

And tomorrow?

I rise again.
