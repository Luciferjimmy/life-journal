Journal Entry – July 18, 2025 (Thursday)
Today was a mind tornado.
My thoughts — scattered, unfiltered, crashing into each other.
It started with that moment of hesitation... following her. That damn follow button. I tossed a coin and let fate decide, but even fate feels unsure lately.
She didn’t respond. No accept, no follow back. Just silence.

And in that silence, my mind created noise. Loud noise.
Am I not enough? Why am I feeling this much? Why the hell does she even matter this much to me?
I didn’t want to think about her, but it kept looping in my head — like some kind of emotional glitch.

But I also did something real today.
I worked on PrimeIntelligence. Made progress. Built, failed, fixed, built again.
Even though the model didn’t act perfectly, it taught me something:

Even logic needs patience. Even science isn’t always clean.

I’m proud that I showed up for that.

Emotionally though?
Today felt like being in a room where the walls are slowly closing in — and I’m screaming but nobody hears.
I lost my calm. I snapped at parents.
And then I hated myself for that.

But I’m not giving up on myself.
