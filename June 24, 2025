Todya i wake up with clarity and like so much motivation that today i am goona kit it no matter what,
i start my day my praying to god then i got freshed up after all that thing i start doing the stuff whcih i need to do right now which is most important.

After completing the most of the work i was just sitting with my thoughts i dont know what was happening with me so many thoughts and ideas then i started writing them down so that i can get
clarity i mean so many idea it just overloaded my brain, but after sometime when i was done i felt like never before i was in clarity what i need to do next.

then i started doing with my app coding after all of that, i was like i can sense some energies it was insane i mean seriously like there is someone protecting me guiding me and i was insane to feel all this never felt anything like this before.
