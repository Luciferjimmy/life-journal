Commit Message: Complete homepage redesign with educational storytelling

Journal Entry:

Felt the old homepage lacked visual storytelling â€” started from scratch.

Rewrote homepage structure focusing on visual learning.

Added new animations like floating particles, spinning qubits.

Simplified quantum explanations using real-life analogies.

Finalized a beautiful, beginner-friendly homepage that guides users toward the simulation.
