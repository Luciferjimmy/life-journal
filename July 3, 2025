July 3, 2025 – The Silence Before the Flame
“The world doesn’t begin with applause. It begins with a whisper.”

Woke up knowing today would be different. Couldn’t explain it, but there was a crackle in the silence — the kind you feel when something’s about to start. I sat at my desk with just one question: What if I wrote a book not to be a writer, but because I had no other choice?

No planning, no outline, just heart.

I started typing.

Chapter 1. A Fire Without a Name.

And suddenly I wasn’t writing. I was confessing. Everything I had carried — the loneliness, the ambition, the chaos, the search for self — it bled onto the page. Hours passed like seconds. My chest ached with the weight of things unspoken. This wasn’t just a book. This was everything I never said aloud.

By night, my eyes burned. But I wasn’t tired.

For the first time in a long while — I felt real.
