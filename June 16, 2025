Journal 16 – June 16, 2025

“What If I Built a School, Not Just a Startup?”

Today a new vision hit me.

What if I create something beyond a business?
What if I build a school that teaches what really matters — business, design, leadership, tech, emotions, humanity?

A school for kids who feel “different” like me.
Not to push them toward ranks, but to help them become builders of the future.

We say every child has a spark.
So why are we still teaching with a bucket of water instead of fuel?

This journal… it’s not just a thought.
This might be my mission.
And when I make it — I won’t just be a founder.

I’ll be the first student of the school I create.
