Commit Message: Reorganized CSS into modular variables and added quantum color palette

Journal Entry:

Broke CSS into a scalable system with variables: --quantum-blue, --quantum-purple, etc.

Rewrote button and layout styles using new theme variables.

Tweaked animations to be more subtle and fluid.

Reviewed homepage UI/UX with fresh eyes and listed points to improve.
