21st June 2025 – The Tired Drive and Tiny Sparks
Today felt long. I didn’t get as much done as I hoped, but somehow I don’t feel that bad. Maybe because even though it wasn’t productive in the way people define it—study, code, hustle—it was more of a breathing day. A resting day.
I scrolled a bit, maybe too much, but I also sat with my thoughts.

I kept thinking about everything I’m juggling: SAT, Amherst essays, NGO work, my own dreams, my inner voice. Sometimes it feels like my mind is running faster than I can handle.
But there was a moment—just one—when I stepped outside in the evening, felt the wind, and thought, "I’m alive. I’m young. I’m doing things that matter." That was enough to bring back a little fire.

Maybe I’m not behind. Maybe I’m just building something slowly. Brick by brick.
