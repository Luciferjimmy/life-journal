Title - Back on streak

Hello, my dear reader, who might be thinking about where I was in the last few days, so I mean I was just out of the town, and because of that, what happened is that I was not able to journal, but 
Now I am back again and will continue to write.
Let me give you all a quick brief, so it was like in the past few days, I was working on some AI project and also some debate competition, and all then were some inspections also, and in all this work 
I just forgot, like I need to journal also, but like today as most of the work is done, so i am rest and thought why not to journal back again.
Today I was feeling like I won a battle, I tried to face all my fears and I am still facing them head on, like I asked god to give me strength and he gave a so much work and all that I need to face
It and in all that I got to know I am already powerful and all then I asked I need to feel confident, then I got places to present my ideas and all I was really good, day after tomorrow there is again
A debate competition, I am feeling a bit confused and a little nervous, also, but I mean both of these can't work for me, I need to work, so I was rthinking I just need to present 2-3 points and that's it 
nothing fancy and all, and slowly I will face all my fears.

Lesson of the Day:
"Face your fears head-on — they lose power the moment you don’t back down."
