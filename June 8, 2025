Journal Entry – 8 June 2025 (Saturday)

# Start of the Day:
Woke up feeling sore from the intense 2.5-hour cricket session the day before. Body was aching — thighs, back, shoulders — but in a weird way, that pain felt like progress. It was a reminder that I pushed myself physically, and it brought a sense of pride.

# Morning Routine:
Even with the soreness, stepped up. Since mom’s not home, I made tea, ate breakfast, and even washed the dishes. Felt like a small but powerful moment — taking responsibility, being self-sufficient, and owning the space I live in.

# Reflections:
Had a big thought — this Indian system, this one-size-fits-all track, it doesn’t work for people like me. Kids aren’t lacking potential, it’s just that their spark gets drowned in expectations and tradition. But what’s crazy is — even after all the doubts and noise, I’m still pushing, still creating. That means something.

# Mindset:
Wasn’t sure if I was doing the “right” things, but there was clarity — I’m doing. That’s more than most. Every step — coding, designing, studying, even doubting — it’s all part of this journey. Whether it’s MIT or a product that changes lives, I’ll keep showing up.

# Thought of the Day:
"Karma is the only thing in our hands. Everything else — birth, death, love, loss — is gifted or taken by someone else."
So I’ll keep doing karma. Keep building. Keep believing.
