1 July 2025 – Monday
Mood: Reignited, Calmly Driven

Highlights:
Back to momentum after mental reset.
Reviewed past work and made plan for coming week (project/hackathon/app).
Maybe did some light commits or organized folders/workspace.
Technical/Creative Progress:
Brainstormed or refined project features.
Reconnected with why behind your build — purpose fuels polish.

Notes to Self:
Don’t chase motivation. Build systems.
A simple, well-executed idea > complicated, abandoned one.
