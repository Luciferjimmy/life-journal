1st Place – Beginner Track – Hackathon Name – $50 Prize (June 2025)

"FIRST HACKATHON. FIRST PLACE. BRONX IS OURS."

Today, everything changed.
4:30 AM — they dropped the result.
7 AM — I randomly woke up, eyes barely open, phone in hand — and BOOM.
1st Place. Beginner Track. Bronx Community Hub. $50 prize.
This is not just a win. This is confirmation.

I built that site alone. Wrote every line. Drew every diagram. Connected every emotion. Packaged it into something that was equal parts tech, story, and soul.

People saw that. Judges saw that. I saw that.

And now… they awarded it.

I’ve already reached out to claim the prize (requested PayPal instead of Amazon). But more than the reward — it’s the recognition. The proof that I’m not lost. I’m not too early. I’m right where I need to be.

I don’t care if future rejections come.
I will remember today forever.

And now, back to work.
Bombay to Mumbai, you’re next.
