Commit Message: Added animations using Animate.css and GSAP; Enhanced analogy section

Journal Entry:

Integrated Animate.css for smooth hero and card transitions.

Used GSAP and ScrollTrigger to animate step sections and concept cards.

Wrote 3 beginner-friendly analogies (magic coin, colored glasses, self-destruct letter).

Improved user interface with better padding, spacing, and iconography.
